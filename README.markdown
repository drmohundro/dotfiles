# About dotfiles

This is my collection of various config files and options for programs like vim or bash (heavy unix focus), though I'm currently still including my powershell configuration as well.

## Installation Instructions

Just drop the config files you're interested in in your HOME directory (`~` on unix systems, `c:\users\USERID` on windows systems).

The powershell files can be dropped under `c:\users\USERID\Documents\WindowsPowerShell`.
