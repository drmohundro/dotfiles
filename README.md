# About dotfiles

This is my collection of various config files and options for programs like vim
or bash (heavy unix focus).

## Installation Instructions

I'm making use of symlinks to point my dotfiles to my actual dev folder - to
make it easier to configure this, I've based my Rakefile off of what I've seen
in many other dotfiles. To install, just run:

    rake install
