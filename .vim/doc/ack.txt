INTRODUCTION                                                            *ack*

This plugin is a front for the Perl module App::Ack.  Ack can be used as a
replacement for grep.  This plugin will allow you to run ack from vim, and
shows the results in a split window.

Ack [options] {pattern} [{directory}]   Search recursively in {directory} (which defaults to
                              the current directory) for the {pattern}.

Files containing the search term will be listed in the split window, along with
the line number of the occurrence, once for each occurrence.  <Enter> on a line
in this window will open the file, and place the cursor on the matching line.
